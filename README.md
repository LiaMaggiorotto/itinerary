MVP User Story:

Trip planning app that keeps everything in one place!

Once an account is created / a user logs in -> directed to account view
From Account View:

  User may edit their account information, create a new trip, and deactivate their account.

Upcoming trips will be visible in a panel on the left and sorted by date

Upon creating a new trip, the user will be able to add the following:

    Add the trip title/destination
    
    Add the trip dates
    
    View and create itinerary items 
    
    Add flight details for all travelers, which will be auto sorted based on the date and time, allowing users to coordinate airport transfers
    
    Create Notes - a feed where they can store packing recommendations, blogs, links, or anything else they may want to reference for their trip at a later date
    
    Each trip will have a unique url using the trip id that is sharable with friends if needed

## Inspiration

As the avid trip planner of my friends and family, I live for a good itinerary. Having historically relied on shared Google Docs, I've long searched for an application that encompasses all the features necessary to allow for group planning, but have yet to find a functioning platform. The final phase of Itinerary will consist of a space that allows all users to contribute and export upcoming adventures.
